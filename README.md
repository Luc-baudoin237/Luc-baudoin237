### 🚀 What I Do

- 🔭 I currently lead health data and research activities at **Douala General Hospital (Cameroon)** under the *Data Science Without Borders (DSWB)* project  
- 🏥 I design and implement **OMOP CDM data standardization pipelines** for large clinical datasets (TB, HIV, respiratory diseases, hemodialysis)  
- 🤖 I build **machine learning models** for clinical prediction (mortality, treatment outcomes, eligibility)  
- 📊 I develop **data-driven dashboards and decision-support tools** using Power BI and Dash  
- 🔗 I work on **health data interoperability, ETL pipelines, and real-world data systems**

### 🔬 Research Interests

My work focuses on the intersection of **AI, public health, and health systems strengthening**, including:

- Early prediction of in-hospital mortality using admission data  
- Machine learning for hemodialysis eligibility and patient outcomes  
- HIV prevention modeling (PrEP uptake prediction)  
- Time series and ML forecasting of hospital admissions  
- Tuberculosis research with a focus on **Community, Rights, and Gender (CRG)**  
- Clinical decision support systems in resource-limited settings
