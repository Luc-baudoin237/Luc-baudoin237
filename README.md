## Hi there 👋

## Description
- 🔭 I’m currently working on large-scale health data standardization and analytics at Douala General Hospital (Cameroon) under the Data Science Without Borders (DSWB) initiative, using the OMOP Common Data Model and real-world clinical datasets (TB, HIV, respiratory diseases, hemodialysis).

- 🌱 I’m currently learning and advancing in machine learning, deep learning, and scalable AI systems for healthcare, with a strong focus on interpretable models (SHAP, ensemble learning) and reproducible research workflows.

## Objectives
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on research projects involving AI in healthcare, clinical prediction models, health data systems (OMOP, DHIS2), and open-source global health initiatives.

- 🤔 I’m looking for help with scaling AI solutions in low-resource settings, multi-site data integration, and advanced model validation for publication in high-impact journals.

- 💬 Ask me about health data science, machine learning in healthcare, OMOP CDM, DHIS2, ETL pipelines, epidemiological analysis, or building dashboards (Power BI, Dash).
## contact
- 📫 How to reach me: Open to professional connections and collaborations via GitHub and LinkedIn.

- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him

- ⚡ Fun fact: I combine clinical research, data engineering, and AI to solve real-world health problems across Africa — from hospital data pipelines to predictive models that support clinical decisions.
